Module to compute the moving average of a list.  For example:

   from movingaverage import movingaverage
   print list(movingaverage([1,2,3,4,5,6], 3))
   >>> [2,3,4,5]

movingaverage(data, sample_size):
   Return the moving averages of the data, with a window size of
   `sample_size`.  `sample_size` must be an integer greater than 0.
